# Assets Distribution Portal

The Assets Distribution Portal allows authors to create custom yet performant search portals into their assets.  This allows companies to expose assets and their metadata to target users.
It is designed to help users find, download and share assets. Users can browse across assets using our card view and search using facets and filters. The portal is customizable so that companies can configure it with their own branding.

## Local development setup

> **_NOTE:_** Users should be on Adobe Corp network for local development.

# macOS Instructions

1. Install the AEM cli `npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
    * If command fails with `EEXIST: file already exists`, then run `npm install -g --force @adobe/aem-cli`
2. Update your `/etc/hosts` file.  Add `localhost.corp.adobe.com` to the localhost line:
   ```
   127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.corp.adobe.com
   ```
3. Create a self-signed certificate:
   ```
   mkdir env
   openssl req -x509 -out env/server.crt -keyout env/server.key \
    -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
    -subj '/CN=localhost.corp.adobe.com' -extensions EXT -config <( \
    printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost.corp.adobe.com\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost.corp.adobe.com\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
   ```
4. Open **Keychain Access** on the Mac, select **System** -> **Certificates** and drag and drop the `server.crt` file you created in the last step
   ![image](https://github.com/adobe/assets-distribution-portal/assets/2372994/4ed62c98-01de-4cc6-b14c-8cb4b837a7b7)
5. Double-click the cert in the list -> expand **Trust** and select "When using this certificate:" **Always Trust**
   ![image](https://github.com/adobe/assets-distribution-portal/assets/2372994/d6375f2d-8ffd-4636-aa1a-91f62b8dd76d)
6. Close **Keychain Access** so it saves the configurations
7. Create a file in the root of this project's directory called `.env`:
   ```bash
   AEM_TLS_CERT=env/server.crt
   AEM_TLS_KEY=env/server.key
   AEM_OPEN=/
   AEM_PORT=443
   ```
8. Now start the local aem cli (helix-cli) - note we use sudo so we can use port 443
   ```bash
   sudo aem up
   ```
9. Using Chrome browser, go to [https://localhost.corp.adobe.com](https://localhost.corp.adobe.com)
10. If you would also like to use Mozilla Firefox instead of Chrome then:
    1. Open Firefox
    2. Enter `about:config` in the address bar, hit `[Enter]`
    3. Click **Accept the Risk and Continue**
    4. In the search, enter `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` and set the value to true
    5. Restart Firefox and navigate to [https://localhost.corp.adobe.com](https://localhost.corp.adobe.com)

# Windows 11 Instructions

> **_NOTE:_** Ensure you have Git and Node.js installed before proceeding. Open CMD and enter `git --version` and `node --version` to verify intallation.

1. Open GitBash, and install the AEM cli `npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
    * If command fails with `EEXIST: file already exists`, then run `npm install -g --force @adobe/aem-cli`
2. Update your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file using a text editor with administrator privileges.  Add `localhost.corp.adobe.com` to the localhost line:
   ```
   127.0.0.1       localhost localhost.corp.adobe.com
   ```
3. Create a self-signed certificate by entering the following four commands into GitBash:
   ```
   mkdir env

   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost.corp.adobe.com\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost.corp.adobe.com\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth" > ext.conf

   openssl req -x509 -out env/server.crt -keyout env/server.key \
   -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
   -subj "//CN=localhost.corp.adobe.com" -extensions EXT -config ext.conf \
   -days 1826

   rm ext.conf
   ```
   This will create the directory `C:\Users\(username)\env` that contains `server.crt` and `server.key`. Move the `env` folder to the root of this project's directory.
4. In the Start Menu, type `Manage computer certificates` and click to open the Local computer certificates storehouse. You will need admin permission to complete the process.
5. Navigate to Certificates â€“ Local Computer > Personal > Certificates. This place stores all the local certificate that is created on the computer. Find the certificate you have created that contains `localhost.corp.adobe.com` in the `Issued To` and `Issued From` columns.
6. Next, on the left panel, expand Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates. Drag and drop the local certificate and drop into this folder. You can also copy and paste it.
7. Create a file in the root of this project's directory called `.env` and use a text editor to modify its contents to the following:
   ```
   AEM_TLS_CERT=env/server.crt
   AEM_TLS_KEY=env/server.key
   AEM_OPEN=/
   AEM_PORT=443
   ```
8. Create a batch file to start the local aem cli (helix cli). Create a file on the desktop with the file extention `.bat` and use a text editor to modify its contents with the following, while making sure to change the directory in the `cd` command to the root directory of the project:
   ```
   @echo off
   %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command "Start-Process PowerShell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList '-NoProfile', '-ExecutionPolicy Bypass', '-Command', 'cd Change-me-to-the-Root-Directory-of-the-Project; aem up --tls-cert env/server.crt --tls-key env/server.key'"
   ```
   Test your batch file. If all has been configured correctly, User Account Control prompt for permission to open Powershell as Administrator. Click yes. Powershell should then open and start the local aem cli.
9. Using Chrome browser, go to [https://localhost.corp.adobe.com](https://localhost.corp.adobe.com)
10. If you would also like to use Mozilla Firefox instead of Chrome then:
    1. Open Firefox
    2. Enter `about:config` in the address bar, hit `[Enter]`
    3. Click **Accept the Risk and Continue**
    4. In the search, enter `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` and set the value to true
    5. Restart Firefox and navigate to [https://localhost.corp.adobe.com](https://localhost.corp.adobe.com)

## Updating Dependencies
To update the dependencies under [scripts/libs](scripts/libs) with newer versions:
1. Delete [scripts/libs](scripts/libs)
2. Update the dependencies in [package.json](package.json) under `dependencies` with the desired versions
3. Update the `copyDependencies` configuration to specify which files from the dependencies to copy:
   * `from`, `to`, and `globOptions` - patterns for [copy-webpack-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/copy-webpack-plugin/) so it adheres to that format.
   * `fileIncludes` - specifies which js or css file(s) to include in [dependencies.json)[scripts/dependencies.json] - these get processed and loaded
   `script` or `link` tags during page load.
4. Update the `externalDependencies` configuration in [package.json](package.json) to specify external dependencies - supports js or css file urls to load
5. Run `npm run update-dependencies`, this will update the dependencies under [scripts/libs](scripts/libs) and add them to [dependencies.json)
6. Run `sudo aem up` and test https://localhost.corp.adobe.com/ to make sure everything still works with the updated dependency versions.
7. Run `git add scripts/libs package.json`, `git commit -m "Update dependencies"` to commit the new updated dependencies.

## Authentication
By default, users are redirected for IMS authentication. e.g. when you visit the base URL you will be prompted for IMS auth. e.g. https://main--assets-distribution-portal--adobe.hlx.page

## Events

The core portal code will emit certain events depending on user actions. When an event fires, it will invoke a provided callback with a single parameter:
javascript event information. The event data will contain a `detail` property with custom additional information for the event. There are two ways that
consumers can listen for these events:

1. (Recommended) Use the core library's functions and constants:

```
import { EventNames, addEventListener } from '/libs/scripts/events.js';

addEventListener(EventNames.DOWNLOAD, (e) => {
  console.log('Received download event with details', e.detail);
});
```

2. Without the core library's functions, if they're not available:

```
document.addEventListener('download', (e) => {
  console.log('Received download event with details', e.detail);
});
```

### Event Names

The following are valid event names, along with the `detail` data for each:

* `download`: One or more asset(s) or rendition(s) have been downloaded.
  * `downloads`: An array of information about each downloaded item. Each item in the array will have these properties:
    * `assetId`: ID of the asset that was downloaded.
    * `assetName`: Name of the asset that was downloaded.
