JIRA: ASSETS-00000

Test URLs:
<!--- For now you shouldn't add a path other than /sample-public-site. We can start changing -->
<!--- the URL after we've figured out how to run the CI on pages that require authentication. -->
<!--- /sample-public-site doesn't require authentication, so this is a way for us to ensure -->
<!--- that Franklin's CI (which we can't configure directly) will pass-->
- Before: https://main--assets-distribution-portal--adobe.hlx.page/sample-public-site
